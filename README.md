# Hi! 👋 I'm Saul (@saulish)

Welcome to my GitHub 🚀  
Here you’ll find projects focused on **backend engineering, systems and algorithms**, along with experiments exploring how to build efficient, reliable and well-designed software.

## About me 👨‍💻
I am a **computer engineering graduate candidate** with a strong focus on **backend and systems**, and production experience after completing a one-year internship at **HP**. I primarily work with **Python and C/C++**, and I am deeply interested in how systems work under the hood: concurrency, process execution, isolation, performance and efficient resource usage.

I have built scalable backends, asynchronous pipelines and systems that integrate **external APIs, databases and algorithms**, with attention to both architecture and real-world production impact.

## Areas of interest 🧠
- Backend engineering and API design  
- Concurrent systems and multithreading  
- Docker and isolated execution environments  
- Algorithms and data structures (especially graphs)  
- Performance optimization and memory efficiency  
- ML applied to systems (embeddings, similarity, analysis)

## Featured projects ✨
- 🔹 **Graph-based Music Recommendation**  
  **FastAPI** backend integrating **Spotify and Deezer APIs**, **PostgreSQL** caching and **graph-based models with Dijkstra** for embedding-driven recommendations.

- 🔹 **Process Scheduling Simulator (C++)**  
  Simulation of operating system scheduling algorithms such as **FIFO and Round Robin**, reinforcing systems fundamentals.

- 🔹 **Biometric Access System (Backend)**  
  **Flask** backend with biometric authentication (facial recognition and keypad) and database integration for access control.

- 🔹 **Assembly Neural Network (x86)**  
  Exploratory project implementing basic neural network operations in **x86 assembly**, focusing on low-level computation and register-level reasoning.

## Continuous learning 🌱
Currently deepening my knowledge in:
- Scalable and reliable backend systems  
- Advanced concurrency and profiling  
- ML/DL applied to real-world systems  
- Modern C++ and Python design practices

## Fun fact ⚡
I started with zero programming knowledge and ended up obsessed with **C++**, systems and squeezing performance out of every resource.  
Understanding what happens “under the hood” makes everything more fun 😄
